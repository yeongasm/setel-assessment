# Setel Job Application Assessment

This repository contains the source code to my take on Setel's assessment. Overall it was a very interesting experience. Think the last time I wrote a web application for a job was about 3 years when I was about to graduate from University. Back then I needed something besides my Final Year Project as a portfolio that I can include in my job applications. Hence, I took my mentor's advice and created a simple "To-do list". And so I locked myself up in my dormitory for about 5 days, only going out for food (Yes, I skipped class and tutorials but the semester was ending so ... meh).

Now with a couple of years of experience already, I figured why not do it again (NOTE: I did not skip work)? Pretty sure it would be a challenging endeavour if I used frameworks that I'm not familiar with I thought. I could've easily just make the back-end API but where is the fun in that. And so I begin my journey by spending a couple of hours everyday after work and I'm not gonna lie, it was pretty challenging since I had to learn a bunch of new frameworks. But after spending a couple of hours in the documentations, things went pretty smooth.

>Note: This is not a full featured web application! I did not include important features like authentication and error handling, but I figured the current state of the application would be suffice for the assessment.

>Note: The microservice requirement is simply two separate modules as I do not have a clear picture on how to implement a proper microservice architecture. I am also unsure if NestJs's microservice plugin fits the definition of a microservice since NestJs defines a microservice as an application that uses a different transport layer.
